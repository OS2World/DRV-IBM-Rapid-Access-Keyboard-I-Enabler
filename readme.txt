IBM Rapid Access Keyboard I Enabler
v0.0.1 (C) 2001 Bart van Leeuwen <bart@netage.nl>

What is this:
This driver enables the extra buttons on the IBM Rapid Access Keyboard I
This keyboard is available as a option from IBM and is the default keyboard for a broad
range of IBM Aptiva Systems.
When this driver is loaded the extra keys will generate Scan Codes like any other key.
Extra software to attach actions to the keys is needed, e.g. XWorkplace works great !

This version does not YET support the extra leds on the keyboard


Usage:
copy the IBMRA1.SYS file to your OS2\BOOT directory
put the following line in your config.sys
DEVICE=C:\OS2\BOOT\IBMRA1.SYS
